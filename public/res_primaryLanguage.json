      "description": "I'm Tyler Egashira. I am a software developer with a passion for empowering people to make their lives more easily through the use of technology. Development and deployment of software and firmware was something that I looked at for a long time, before making the jump from the medical field to technology. Everything we use today is touched by technology, from agriculture to entertainment. I find a passion in empowering people to live their lives more easily through the use of technology. The world is changing every day, and technology has become such an integral part of it. Using my skills in communication, logical deduction, and research. I firmly believe that I can be a part of that change, helping technology become more accessible for all.",
